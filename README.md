# Helloworld


hi HNG

This is my first experience using github, i downloaded the figma app yesterday which is also another first time experience.
I'm willing to commit to this program because I love design from the heart. 
I'm 22 and this is also my first time taking the UI/UX experience course
before this I've tried my hands on differnt course but it just didn't click for me
nothing makes my heart race more than when I see a beautiful well sketched design.
thank you for this opportunity and I'm willing to bring out the best of my creativity to the end of thid program and after.
